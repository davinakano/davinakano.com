## Introduction

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Patients First was a project developed during my UX Design Bootcamp at
  BrainStation. Amongst other deliverables and lectures, we incrementally worked
  on it for 3 weeks as a way to apply the acquired knowledge. <br />
  <br />
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Patients First is a government led initiative aimed at improving healthcare
  for patients. The initiative aims to place people and patients at the center
  of healthcare by more deeply understanding patient needs and experiences,
  while improving patient outcomes.
  <br />
  In B.C., walk-in clinics are responsible for serving a big portion of the
  population looking for preventive care.
  <br />
  <br />
  However, often times the experience of finding a walk-in clinic where the patient
  is sure to be seen is a frustrating and time consuming experience.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

## Research

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  In order to understand deeper about this topic and how it relates to other
  people, I focused my efforts on analyzing news from different media outlets
  and statistics from academic articles.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<FlexContainer style={{ justifyContent: "space-evenly", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <BigStats
    title="24,546"
    description="people moved to B.C. in the first two quarters of 2021"
    sourceURL="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/canada-interprovincial-migration-statistics-october-2021"
  />
  <BigStats
    title="6,943"
    description="currently active family practitioners"
    sourceURL="https://www.cpsbc.ca/files/pdf/2020-21-Annual-Report.pdf"
  />
</FlexContainer>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  These articles, amongst other research materials, led me to the conclusion
  that there is already a shortage of family practitioners in B.C. which makes
  it even more difficult to find doctors accepting new patients.
  <br />
  <br />
  The official resource for finding a family doctor states that it can take 12+ months
  in the waitlist for one to be contacted.
  <br />
  <br />
  Therefore, for a big portion of the population, it is necessary to resort to
  walk-in clinics for preventive care. After the secondary research, I set out
  to interview adults living in B.C. that don't have a family doctor and have
  visited walk-in clinics for preventive care. The findings were grouped into
  <i>"Pain Point"</i>, <i>"Behavior"</i> and <i>"Motivation"</i>.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Since the goal is to help people accomplish their goals while they are still
  able to do so, I set out to interview working young adults that had a list of
  items that they want to accomplish. <br /> The findings were grouped into
  <i>"Pain Point"</i>, <i>"Behavior"</i> and <i>"Motivation"</i>.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After going through the interview transcripts, I could extract three themes:
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

- Booking appointment in walk-in clinics
- Perception of care difference between walk-in X emergency care
- Walk-in search and waiting experience

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  From the primary and secondary research done so far, I was able to synthesize
  them in the following <b>How Might We</b> question and <b>persona</b>:
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<BigImpactulText text="How might we improve the access to quality walk-in clinic experiences for the adult population of B.C. that donâ€™t yet have a family doctor when seeking for preventive care?" />

## Ideate

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After considering multiple possible User Stories and grouping them into Epics,
  it became clear that people like Camila would benefit the most by focusing on
  improving the experience of searching walk-in clinics and checking their
  current availability. Therefore, the main task flow proposed below was for the{" "}
  <i>Clinic Search</i> task.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  With a Task Flow at hand, it was time for getting inspiration on existing UI
  layouts and components on a mobile screen. One of the main considerations was
  to look out there for how Map and Calendar / Appointment interactions were
  done in other apps.

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Before settling on a specific style, I did some sketches of my own to
  consolidate some of the ideas extracted from the InVision inspiration board.
  The goal here was to try to accomplish the proposed the task with the least
  amount of steps.

</video>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  As a combination of the ideas from the exploratory sketches, I've arrived in a
  "Solution Sketch" which would then serve as a guiding point for building a low
  fidelity wireframe and start testing out with people that matched with the
  participant criteria.

## Prototype & Test

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  The usability tests were done remotely and their purpose was to evaluate the
  discovery of the walk-in search functionality and the experience of the
  appointment booking flow.
  <br />
  The results were positive. The single failed task for one of the participants
  was due to a degree of ambiguity on the wording of the script question related
  to said task.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

- **T1** -> Find the Map screen
- **T2** -> Book appointment
- **T3** -> Understanding of where and when the appointment was created

<br />

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Based on the interview results and the insights derived from the transcripts,
  a Design Prioritization Matrix was created so that I could focus on the most
  impactul changes for a second round of interviews.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  A new revised prototype was created to accomodate the changes that could be
  done in time for the next deliverable deadline. Doing the project solo only
  allowed me to tackle a few of the suggestions.

## Afterword & Next Steps

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  This was the first project done in the BrainStation's UX Diploma bootcamp in
  which I received a design prompt with a limited scope (the design prompt
  mentioned a ficticious health care company asking for a design intervention to
  help patients get better care). This constraint made me realize how important
  the process of drafting assumptions and later validating those with primary
  and secondary research before trying to come up with solutions.
  <br />
  <br />
  As of next steps, it would be great to do at least one more Usability Testing with
  the new iteration of the mid-fidelity interactive prototype and also creating branding
  guidelines so that I can produce high-fidelity mockups.
