# Patients First

### Facilitating the discoverability of available walk-in clinics in B.C. <br /><br />

“_Memento Mori_” (latin for 'remember that you [have to] die') is an artistic or symbolic trope acting as a reminder of the inevitability of death. <br /><br />
It is natural to have hopes and dreams throughout life but it is common that those get overthrown by the adult working life, only to remember after it is often much harder to accomplish them. We all have limited time in this life and it is virtually impossible to do every single thing there is.
