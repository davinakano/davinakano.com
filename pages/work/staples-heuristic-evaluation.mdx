## Introduction

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Staples was founded in 1986 in Brighton, Massachusetts, U.S. The Canadian
  division started the operarion in 1991 based in Richmond Hill, Ontario,
  currently it has over 300 stores across Canada. Staples is present in 25
  countries worldwide. Solutionshop is a complete marketplace inside Staples
  Canada that handles the design and print solutions.
  <br />
  <br />
  A heuristic evaluation was conducted for the web app experience of printing pictures
  and having them delivered. The violations were identified by a team of two students
  during BrainStation's UX Bootcamp: Kleber Sousa and myself, whereas the redesign
  proposals for the violations were done solo by me.
  <br />

<br />
<br />

## Evaluation method

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  We based our evaluation on the industry standard Nielsen Norman Group's 10
  Usability Heuristics. Authored by Jakob Nielsen, these heuristics have
  remained relevant and unchanged since 1994 which is a testament of its
  timelessness and effectiveness on assessing usability.
  <br />
  <br />
  The severity rating scale ranges from 0 to 4 where 0 means no violation and 4 indicates
  a usability catastrophe.

## Heuristic Violations

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  During the task proposed of printing a picture through Solutionshop's web app,
  we have uncovered the following:

<FlexContainer style={{ justifyContent: "space-evenly", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <BigStats title="7" description="heuristic violations severity 3 or higher" />
  <BigStats title="9" description="total heuristic violations" />

  width={1920}
  height={1080}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  For the next violation, the issue consisted in having two companies logos
  (Staples' and solutionshop's) redirecting to two different websites. It is
  disorienting for a user to be redirected to a different home page from where
  they came from. <br />
  Thus, Staples' home page does not have a clear connection with solutionshop's.

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  At the time this heuristic evaluation was done, the footer links had a
  mismatching style and misaligned that violated the{" "}
  <i>"Aesthetics and minimalist design"</i> heuristic.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  The modals throughout the process don't follow a patterns or standard, which
  requires extra cognitive effort in order to understand and select the desired
  option. One of the modals have three buttons while two of them have the same
  visual style and present similar options.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/staples/fourth-violation-after.jpg"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  While uploading an image, if it had low resolution, there was a warning symbol
  displayed on top of the uploaded image. However, other than the warning
  symbol, there was no further instructions on why that happened or how to fix
  it.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<CaseStudyImage

  width={1920}
  height={1080}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Besides the alignment concerns on the checkout page, the cart items don't
  provide buttons for editing or removing themselves. This removes the user
  control, hence violating the <i>"User control and freedom"</i> heuristic.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/staples/sixth-violation.jpg"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  It may be deliberate but having the back button have the same styles as the
  other text on the same screen is misleading as it doesn't have enough
  affordances.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/staples/seventh-violation.jpg"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Throughout the experience, when clicking on broken links, there is a cryptic
  404 message that might not be familiar for a non-tech-savvy audience. The
  proposal solution is to add a more friendly page that keeps the header and
  footer so that the user can recover from such state.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/staples/eight-violation.jpg"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Given the assumption that Staples (and solutionshop) are companies known by a
  wide audience, and the process of ordering a photo print may not be
  straightforward to all, it is deemed important to have easy access to
  documentation & help articles. However, during a quick search it was not
  possible to find the relevant help on how to upload and print pictures.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

## Afterword & Next Steps

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  The objective of this student project was to observe a real application from
  an established company and exercise the attention on usability based on the
  Nielsen Norman Group's 10 Usability Heuristics. These violations and their
  paired redesign suggestions are not final as those are subjective to the eye
  of the evaluator.
  <br />
  Personally, I've learned that being explicit on the meaning of your design and
  keeping it consistent across the whole experience is essential to keep a high
  standard of usability, specially on services that have such a wide range of
  people as their target. <br />
  <br />
  As of next steps, it would be great to contact the actual companies and offer
  an executive summary of the heuristic evaluation to spark a conversation
  within their design team so that more design iterations can be done in order
  to provide a better user experience on the selected task flow.
