## Introduction

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Hoshii is a capstone project developed during my UX Design Bootcamp at
  BrainStation. Amongst other deliverables and lectures, we incrementally worked
  on it for 10 weeks using our newly acquired skills. <br />
  <br />
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  It all started with the thought of “<i>Memento Mori</i>” (latin for 'remember
  that you [have to] die') which is an artistic or symbolic trope acting as a
  reminder of the inevitability of death. It is natural to have hopes and dreams
  throughout life but it is common that those get overthrown by the adult
  working life, only to remember after it is often much harder to accomplish
  them. We all have limited time in this life and it is virtually impossible to
  do every single thing there is.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

## Research

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  In order to understand deeper about this topic and how it relates to other
  people, I focused my efforts on analyzing news from different media outlets
  and statistics from academic articles.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<FlexContainer style={{ justifyContent: "space-evenly", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <BigStats
    title="91.2%"
    description="of surveyed participants have a bucket list"
    sourceURL="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946728/"
  />
  <BigStats
    title="65.7%"
    description="of elderly people reported having regrets in life"
    sourceURL="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26771555_Regret_in_Later_Life_Exploring_Relationships_between_Regret_Frequency_Secondary_Interpretive_Control_Beliefs_and_Health_in_Older_Individuals"
  />
</FlexContainer>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  These articles, amongst other research materials, led me to the conclusion
  that such desires can be deemed more difficult to be accomplished in an
  advanced age, potentially causing regret and unsatisfaction towards life.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Since the goal is to help people accomplish their goals while they are still
  able to do so, I set out to interview working young adults that had a list of
  items that they want to accomplish. <br /> The findings were grouped into
  <i>"Pain Point"</i>, <i>"Behavior"</i> and <i>"Motivation"</i>.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After going through the interview transcripts, I could extract three themes:
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

- Goal tracking tools
- Accountability during goal tracking
- Source of inspiration for setting goals

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  From the primary and secondary research done so far, I was able to synthesize
  them in the following <b>How Might We</b> question and <b>persona</b>:

<br />
<br />

## Ideate

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After considering multiple possible User Stories and grouping them into Epics,
  it was clear that managing the Wishes themselves would be a core part of the
  app. However, since the main difference of this project with the common TO-DO
  app is the social aspect, I've decided to explore a "
  <i>Group Wish Participation</i>" task flow.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage src="/assets/hoshii/task-flow.jpg" width={1100} height={608} />

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  With a Task Flow at hand, it was time for getting inspiration on both the
  overall mood of the application and some references of how to layout UI
  components on a mobile screen. One of the main considerations was to look out
  there for how Social Interactions are done in other apps.

</p>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Before settling on a specific style, I did some sketches of my own to
  consolidate some of the ideas extracted from the InVision inspiration board.
  The goal here was to try to accomplish the proposed the task with the least
  amount of steps.

</video>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  As a combination of the ideas from the exploratory sketches, I've arrived in a
  "Solution Sketch" which would then serve as a guiding point for building a low
  fidelity wireframe and start testing out with people that matched with the
  participant criteria.

## Prototype & Test

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  The first round of testing was done with 5 people and the results were
  underwhelming. All interviewees framed the social aspects of the app as an
  events app. However, the intention with the "Group Wish" was to have a place
  where other people could give you advice / encouragement on how to realize
  your wish.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

- **T1** -> Locate / correlate the Social menu with Social capabilities
- **T2** -> Understand the difference between Feed and Group Wishes tab
- **T3** -> Understand that participating in a "Group Wish" subscribes the user to notifications about it

<CaseStudyImage

  width={1100}
  height={562}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Based on the interview results and the insights derived from the transcripts,
  a Design Prioritization Matrix was created so that I could focus on the most
  impactul changes for a second round of interviews.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

  width={1753}
  height={795}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  A new revised prototype was created to accomodate the changes that could be
  done in time for the next deliverable deadline. Doing the project solo only
  allowed me to tackle a few of the suggestions.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage

  width={1044}
  height={868}

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After the second round of interviews, it became clear that the changes paid
  off. There was no confusion anymore around what Group Wishes actually meant
  (now labelled as Public Wishes instead). All five new interviewees were able
  to complete the tasks proposed.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Yet, there were a few tweaks that could be done to further enhance the
  experience. Some interviewees gave improvement suggestions and those are
  outlined in the Design Prioritization Matrix below. The changes were applied
  in the high fidelity prototype.
