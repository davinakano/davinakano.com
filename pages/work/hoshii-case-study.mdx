## Introduction

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Hoshii is a capstone project developed during my UX Design Bootcamp at
  BrainStation. Amongst other deliverables and lectures, we incrementally worked
  on it for 10 weeks using our newly acquired skills. <br />
  <br />
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  It all started with the thought of “<i>Memento Mori</i>” (latin for 'remember
  that you [have to] die') which is an artistic or symbolic trope acting as a
  reminder of the inevitability of death. It is natural to have hopes and dreams
  throughout life but it is common that those get overthrown by the adult
  working life, only to remember after it is often much harder to accomplish
  them. We all have limited time in this life and it is virtually impossible to
  do every single thing there is.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

## Research

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  In order to understand deeper about this topic and how it relates to other
  people, I focused my efforts on analyzing news from different media outlets
  and statistics from academic articles.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<FlexContainer style={{ justifyContent: "space-evenly", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <BigStats
    title="91.2%"
    description="of surveyed participants have a bucket list"
    sourceURL="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946728/"
  />
  <BigStats
    title="65.7%"
    description="of elderly people reported having regrets in life"
    sourceURL="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26771555_Regret_in_Later_Life_Exploring_Relationships_between_Regret_Frequency_Secondary_Interpretive_Control_Beliefs_and_Health_in_Older_Individuals"
  />
</FlexContainer>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  These articles, amongst other research materials, led me to the conclusion
  that such desires can be deemed more difficult to be accomplished in an
  advanced age, potentially causing regret and unsatisfaction towards life.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Since the goal is to help people accomplish their goals while they are still
  able to do so, I set out to interview working young adults that had a list of
  items that they want to accomplish. <br /> The findings were grouped into
  <i>"Pain Point"</i>, <i>"Behavior"</i> and <i>"Motivation"</i>.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After going through the interview transcripts, I could extract three themes:
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

- Goal tracking tools
- Accountability during goal tracking
- Source of inspiration for setting goals

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  From the primary and secondary research done so far, I was able to synthesize
  them in the following <b>How Might We</b> question and <b>persona</b>:
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<BigImpactulText text="How might we increase the likelihood of goal-oriented young adults to check off their bucket list items?" />

<br />
<br />

## Ideate

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After considering multiple possible User Stories and grouping them into Epics,
  it was clear that managing the Wishes themselves would be a core part of the
  app. However, since the main difference of this project with the common TO-DO
  app is the social aspect, I've decided to explore a "
  <i>Group Wish Participation</i>" task flow.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage src="/assets/hoshii/task-flow.jpg" width={1100} height={608} />

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  With a Task Flow at hand, it was time for getting inspiration on both the
  overall mood of the application and some references of how to layout UI
  components on a mobile screen. One of the main considerations was to look out
  there for how Social Interactions are done in other apps.

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Before settling on a specific style, I did some sketches of my own to
  consolidate some of the ideas extracted from the InVision inspiration board.
  The goal here was to try to accomplish the proposed the task with the least
  amount of steps.

</video>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  As a combination of the ideas from the exploratory sketches, I've arrived in a
  "Solution Sketch" which would then serve as a guiding point for building a low
  fidelity wireframe and start testing out with people that matched with the
  participant criteria.

## Prototype & Test

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  The first round of testing was done with 5 people and the results were
  underwhelming. All interviewees framed the social aspects of the app as an
  events app. However, the intention with the "Group Wish" was to have a place
  where other people could give you advice or encouragement on how to realize
  your wish.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

- **T1** -> Locate / correlate the Social menu with Social capabilities
- **T2** -> Understand the difference between Feed and Group Wishes tab
- **T3** -> Understand that participating in a "Group Wish" subscribes the user to notifications about it

<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/hoshii/interview-results-1.jpg"
  width={1100}
  height={562}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Based on the interview results and the insights derived from the transcripts,
  a Design Prioritization Matrix was created so that I could focus on the most
  impactul changes for a second round of interviews.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/hoshii/design-prioritization-matrix-1.jpg"
  width={1753}
  height={795}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  A new revised prototype was created to accomodate the changes that could be
  done in time for the next deliverable deadline. Doing the project solo only
  allowed me to tackle a few of the suggestions.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/hoshii/second-prototype.png"
  width={1044}
  height={868}
/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After the second round of interviews, it became clear that the changes paid
  off. There was no confusion anymore around what Group Wishes actually meant
  (now labelled as Public Wishes instead). All five new interviewees were able
  to complete the tasks proposed.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyImage
  src="/assets/hoshii/interview-results-2.jpg"
  width={1100}

/>

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Yet, there were a few tweaks that could be done to further enhance the
  experience. Some interviewees gave improvement suggestions and those are
  outlined in the Design Prioritization Matrix below. The changes were applied
  in the high fidelity prototype.

## Branding

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After a through name exploration process involving 15+ candidates, the name
  chosen for the brand was <b>Hoshii</b> which is a Japanese word used to
  express <b>desire</b>. Also, it is a pun for 星 (hoshi) which means{" "}
  <b>star</b> and matches with the shooting star theme of the app. <br /> Even
  though it is Japanese word, it didn't present a pronunciation challenge for
  most English speakers surveyed.

<br />

## High Fidelity Prototype

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  As a final deliverable for this project and after having decided the name,
  colours and typography, I was able to produce a high fidelity prototype
  (sample screens and interactive prototype below). This was a good opportunity
  for me to exercise the usage of colours and how to organize my assets in
  reusable components so that I could experiment with different versions with
  ease.

  height={1154}

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Please feel free to try the high fidelity prototype below! <br /> In this
  scenario, Amanda is looking for wish inspirations from others and finds "ride
  a horse" to resonate with her. She then wants to receive notifications to know
  more about how to realize said wish.

## Extra: Marketing Website

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  In the antecipation of a future were this application has been fully developed
  and tested, I have created mockups of a marketing website to accompany it.
  Given the shooting star theme and mood, the design concept behind it gives the
  suggestion of a landscape coming from sky to land while having a "feature
  section" inside a cloud of thought and airplane banners for testimonials.

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  When Amanda is out and about, she can mark their wishes as realized directly
  from her wrist! <br />
  The Apple Watch companion app brings a focused experience where she can view her
  personal wishes and receive notification on comments about her public wishes. In
  that way, she doesn't have to reach out for her phone while experiencing the best
  life she can have.

## Afterword & Next Steps

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Despite being done in a bootcamp setting, this project was very important for
  me to go through a full UX process for the first time. Coming from the
  software development world, most of my interactions with the design team were
  through mockups and going through all these steps made me understand the
  amount of work that needs to be done before the first rectangle is on the
  screen.
  <br />
  <br />
  As of next steps, it would be great to flesh out other tasks flows (specially the
  ones related with creating and deleting personal wishes). Also, given that only
  two rounds of User Testing were done, I would like to conduct another one with
  the high fidelity version of the prototype. Ultimately, it would be great to develop
  the app and take it to the App Store.
