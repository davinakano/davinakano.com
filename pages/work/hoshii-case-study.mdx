## Introduction

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Hoshii is a capstone project developed during my UX Design Bootcamp at
  BrainStation. Amongst other deliverables and lectures, we incrementally worked
  on it for 10 weeks using our newly acquired skills. <br />
  <br />
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  It all started with the thought of “<i>Memento Mori</i>” (latin for 'remember
  that you [have to] die') which is an artistic or symbolic trope acting as a
  reminder of the inevitability of death. It is natural to have hopes and dreams
  throughout life but it is common that those get overthrown by the adult
  working life, only to remember after it is often much harder to accomplish
  them. We all have limited time in this life and it is virtually impossible to
  do every single thing there is.

## Research

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  In order to understand deeper about this topic and how it relates to other
  people, I focused my efforts on analyzing news from different media outlets
  and statistics from academic articles.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

<FlexContainer style={{ justifyContent: "space-evenly", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <BigStats
    title="91.2%"
    description="of surveyed participants have a bucket list"
    sourceURL="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946728/"
  />
  <BigStats
    title="65.7%"
    description="of elderly people reported having regrets in life"
    sourceURL="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26771555_Regret_in_Later_Life_Exploring_Relationships_between_Regret_Frequency_Secondary_Interpretive_Control_Beliefs_and_Health_in_Older_Individuals"
  />
</FlexContainer>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  These articles, amongst other research materials, led me to the conclusion
  that such desires can be deemed more difficult to be accomplished in an
  advanced age, potentially causing regret and unsatisfaction towards life.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  Since the goal is to help people accomplish their goals while they are still
  able to do so, I set out to interview working young adults that had a list of
  items that they want to accomplish. <br /> The findings were grouped into
  <i>"Pain Point"</i>, <i>"Behavior"</i> and <i>"Motivation"</i>.
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  After going through the interview transcripts, I could extract three themes:
</CaseStudyParagraph>

<br />
<br />

- Goal tracking tools
- Accountability during goal tracking
- Source of inspiration for setting goals

<br />
<br />

<CaseStudyParagraph>
  From the primary and secondary research done so far, I was able to synthesize
  them in the following <b>How Might We</b> question and <b>persona</b>:

<br />
<br />

<BigImpactulText text="How might we increase the likelihood of goal-oriented young adults to check off their bucket list items?" />
